# Electron-License-Distribution-template

A modern TypeScript-based template for securely distributing Electron applications with integrated licensing and code protection. This template leverages powerful tools like **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Keygen.sh**, and **Bytenode** to deliver a fast, customizable, and secure development experience.

### Features:
- **React Integration**: Build interactive user interfaces with React.
- **TypeScript Support**: Write scalable and maintainable code with full TypeScript integration.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Style your app effortlessly with a utility-first CSS framework.
- **Secure Licensing**: Integrates with Keygen.sh for license generation and validation.
- **Code Protection**: Secures your TypeScript/JavaScript code by compiling it to binary format using Bytenode.
- **Optimized Build**: Uses Vite for fast development, hot module replacement (HMR), and optimized production builds.
- **Customizable Distribution**: A flexible solution for deploying secure, licensed Electron applications.

### Use Cases:
- Protect commercial Electron applications from unauthorized use and redistribution.
- Secure sensitive business logic with binary-compiled code.
- Build modern, feature-rich apps with React, styled using Tailwind CSS.
- Implement scalable, license-based distribution systems for Electron applications.
